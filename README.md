# babylonjs-npm-demo
Example repo for reproducing babylonjs bugs with NPM-loaded babylon

This super simple application loads [Babylon.js](http://www.babylonjs.com/) using typescript imports from the npm-distribution of babylonjs.
Nearly everything works with the odd exception of shadows. 

This is the same scene code as http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#OPL98

## Installation steps
1. Install dependencies
```
npm i
```
2. Build & run

```
3. Open browser to http://localhost:8080
